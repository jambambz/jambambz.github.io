	<p>This anime is one of my first watched animes. I will not go into many story details for this review as it is amazing and deserves a watch
	. The story's main characters are funny,relateable, and interesting. Seeing how these characters grow up will warm your heart and even bring out some tears. The action scenes alone give this series a 9/10. But thanks to the great story and characters I give this anime 11/10 a MUST WATCH for ALL ANIME LOVERS!
