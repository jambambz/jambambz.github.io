	<p>THIS WAS THE WORST ANIME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		ok im just kidding I actually for one like this anime, well the first half of season 1. The rest is not interesting, so thsi review will mostly go over
		the first half of season 1. First half was amazing, it had great action and drama. I think Kirito was a little to edgy though.
		Other than that this anime is a stream-it kinda thing. Watch it if you really have nothing else to do. 6/10 Most of the anime is TRASH. The first half of season 1 is carrying it tbh :).
