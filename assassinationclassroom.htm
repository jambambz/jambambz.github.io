	<h1>ASSASSINATION CLASSROOM</h1>
	<p>This anime is a hella of a ride to say the least. It is drama, action, and comedy anime. The anime has excellent twists
		and an even better story. When you think you understand everything, everything gets turned on its head. However, even wiht these benefits
		there are some downsides. The pace is kind of wierd and sometimes you wish you'd do things the easy way. 8/10 must watch for any simping anime fan.
